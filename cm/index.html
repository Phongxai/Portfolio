							Front-End Developer

						<p>
							Hi, my name is Phongxai Vang and I want to join the C + M team as a Frontend developer.</p>
						<p>
							Previously, I was a contractor doing frontend development at Ascension Development group. I provided assistance to the Creative Lead in building websites and helping Non-profit organizations increase their digital outreach. The Goal? To raise awareness
							or increase donors/volunteers. </p>
						<p style="color:black">
							<strong>
									Here is an interactive site I created to showcase why we would do great work together.
								</strong>

							Creativity plays a big role in most if not all fields. Without it, we lack vision, innovation and change.

								<strong>
									Below is an example of my creativity:
								</strong>
							</span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:black"><strong>My Task?</strong></span> To redesign an certain aspects of the organizations website. While going through their old site I notice a few things. Their original color scheme didn't represent who they were and each
							page contained very little information. Instead of doing design snippets, I suggested that we change the whole look and feel of their new site. Almost as if we were doing a rebranding of their organization, but not really (If that makes sense).
							Their mission will be the same. Just the look and feel of their website will be different.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:black"><strong>My Goal?</strong></span> A better experience for users and a color scheme that would better fit their organization.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:black"><strong>My idea?</strong></span> A one page website that would tell a story.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:black"><strong>My Outcome?</strong></span> The organization liked my idea and decided to go with my design.

						<div class="seperator"></div>
						<p>
							Learning is an ongoing process and I consider myself forever a student. As we all know technology is advancing fast. The only way to keep up is to learn.</p>
						<p>
							Currently, I have been focusing quite a bit of my time on UI/UX. The reason it interests me is because UI/UX is a multidisciplinary field. A field that requires visual competence, an understanding of human computer interaction and creativity.
							I've been specifically learning about visual and graphic design as well as user testing and user research. A large topic, but I love learning about it.

								Helping

						<h3>
							We love to Help
						</h3>
						<div class="seperator"></div>
						<p>
							I believe the most important aspect of helping is building relationships. Establishing good relationships is key to any project, team or company. Bridging people together is the start of success.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently, I have been volunteering at Edison High School to help students design and prototype their web application. The students are part a program called Junior Achievement. This program aims to inspire the next generation of young entrepreneurs by having them plan
							and start their own business. Their business was a student rewards program.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:black"><strong>My role?</strong></span> To help guide and teach the students how to plan, design and build a prototype of their web application.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="color:black"><strong>My Goal?</strong></span> Inspire the students to have an entrepreneurial spirit and give them an introduction to the world of digital. To the left is an early low fidelity wireframe I had the students do.
